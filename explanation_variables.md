VARIABLES IN META DATA

- probe_id: ID to identify the measurement 
- plot_id: ID of the measurement location
- start_date: start date of the measurement period
- start_time: start time of the measurement period
- end_date: end date of the measurement period
- end_time: end time of the measurement period
- lat: latitude
- lon: longitude
- org_layer: thickness of the organic layer at forest plots 
- excess_length: length with which the probe protruded from the soil (measurements in the air were removed from the data and all measurements in soil were assigned to the corresponding depths)
- probe_length: total length of the probe in cm
- land_use: land use category (forest, grassland, or arable land)
- time_res: temporal resolution of the measurements in minutes
- sampling_design: describes the sampling design to which the measurement belongs (weekly, monthly or permanent)
