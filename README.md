# Soil temperature and soil moisture probe measurement data
This repository contains soil temperature and soil moisture data collected in the Fichtelgebirge Mountains between November 2021 and December 2022. Measurements were taken with 15 probes (Drill & Drop Probe RS232, Sentek Technologies, Australia), with a vertical resolution of 10 cm down to a depth of 90 cm or 120 cm. By shifting the probes on a weekly or monthly basis, the dataset includes 251 different measurement locations. In addition, there were 2 permanent measurement locations.
Details on the soil probes and sampling design can be found in High-resolution soil temperature and soil moisture patterns in space, depth, and time: an interpretable machine learning modeling approach, published in Geoderma.
