# Soil temperature and soil moisture probe measurement data
This repository contains soil temperature and soil moisture data collected in the Fichtelgebirge Mountains between November 2021 and December 2022. Measurements were taken with 15 probes (Drill & Drop Probe RS232, Sentek Technologies, Australia), having a vertical resolution of 10 cm down to a depth of 90 or 120 cm. By shifting the probes in a weekley or monthley term, the dataset includes 251 differnt locations. In addition, there are 2 permanent measurements.
Details on soil probes and sampling desing can be found in "High-resolution soil temperature and soil moisture patterns in space, depth and time: an interpretable machine learning modelling approach" published in Geoderma.
